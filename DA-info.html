                <p> Digital Accessibility is the design of technology products and enviornments to help people with various disabilities not to be 
                    impeded or otherwide unable to partake in use of the service, product or function.

                    It Ensures that websites, applications, and digital tools are usable by everyone, regardless of their abilities. This includes 
                    people with visual, auditory, motor, or cognitive disabilities. 
                    Accessible design removes barriers, enabling all users to perceive, understand, navigate, and interact with digital content effectively.

            <img class="DA-img" src="AccessibilityIcons-FontAwesome.png" alt="digital-accessibilty-img">
            <p> Accessibility is not just a legal rewuiremnt or a checklist item, it's a commitment to inclusion. Over one billion people globally live with a disability, 
                and when digital experiences aren't built with them in mind, they're excluded from vital information, services, and opportunities. By prioritzinfg accessibility, we create 
                equitable experiences and open the foor to innovation that benefits everyone.

            <h2 class="benefits-head-section=h2"> Who benefits from Accessibility?</h2>
            <p> Everyone. Accessibiltity features like closed captions, voice commans, text resizing, and keyboard navigation improve usability for all users-- not just those with disabilities.
                Whether you're navigating a site in bright sunlight or using a slow internet connection, accessible design makes digital experiences smoother, faster, and more intuitive.

            <h2 class="tips-head-section-h2"> Tips & Tricks.</h2>
            <p> <ol>
                <li>
                    <strong> Use Clear, Simple Language</strong>
                    <p> Write in a way that's easy to read and understand. Avoid jargon or overly complex sentence structures, 
                        especially on high-traffic or instructional pages.
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Add Alt Texts to All Images</strong>
                    <p> Ensure all meaningul images have desciptive alternative text so screen reader users can understand the content and purpose of visuals.
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Ensure Good Color Contrast</strong>
                    <p> Use high-contrast color combinations between text and background. This helps years with low vision or color blindness read your content with ease.
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Make All Content Keyboard Accessible</strong>
                    <p> Ensure that every part of your website or app can be navigated using a keyboard alone. This is essential for users who cannot use a mouse.
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Use Headings Properly</strong>
                    <p> Structure content using proper heading levels (e.g., H1 for main titles, H2 for subheadings). This helps screen reader users navigate more efficiently.
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Provide Captions and Transcripts</strong>
                    <p> Include closed captions for videos and transccripts for audio content to make multimedia accessible to users who are deaf or hard of hearing.
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Avoid Using Color Alone to Convey Meaning</strong>
                    <p> If you're using color to show status (like red for errors), pair it with icons or text to ensure the information is accessible to colorblind users.
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Label Form Fields Clearly</strong>
                    <p> All form fields should have visible, descriptive labels. Use ARIA lavels or label tags to ensure screen readers can interpret them accurately.
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Design Responsive, Scalable Layouts</strong>
                    <p> Make sure your site or app works well on all screen sizes and allows text resing without breaking the layout
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Test with Real Users and Assistive Tech</strong>
                    <p> Incorpoeate feedback from people with disabilities and test with tools like screen readers, voice control software, and browser zoom.
                    </p>
