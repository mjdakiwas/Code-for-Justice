            <h1 class="head-section"> What is Digital Accessibility?</h1>
            <p> Digital Accessibility is the design of technology products and enviornments to help people with various disabilities not to be 
                impeded or otherwide unable to partake in use of the service, product or function.

                It Ensures that websites, applications, and digital tools are usable by everyone-- regardless of their abilities. This includes 
                people with visual, auditory, motor, or cognitive disabilities. 
                Accessible design removes barriers, enabling all users to perceive, understand, navigate, and interact with digital content effectively.
            </p>

            <h1 class="head-section"> Why it Matters.</h1>
            <p> Accessibility is not just a legal rewuiremnt or a checklist item-- it's a commitment to inclusion. Over one billion people globally live with a disability, 
                and when digital experiences aren't built with them in mind, they're excluded from vital information, services, and opportunities. By prioritzinfg accessibility, we create 
                equitable experiences and open the foor to innovation that benefits everyone.
            </p>

            <h1 class="head-section"> Who benefits from Accessibility?</h1>
            <p> Everyone. Accessibiltity features like closed captions, voice commans, text resizing, and keyboard navigation improve usability for all users-- not just those with disabilities.
                Whether you're navigating a site in bright sunlight or using a slow internet connection, accessible design makes digital experiences smoother, faster, and more intuitive. 
            </p>

            <h1 class="head-section"> Our Commitment.</h1>
            <p> We believe accessibility is a shared responsibility. Our team incorporates inclusive design principles from the ground up and routinely tests our digital experiences 
                against global standards like the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG).
                But our efforts go beyond compliances-- we strive top foster a digital culturw where everyone feels welcomed, seen, and empowered.
            </p>

            <h1 class="head-section"> How You Can Get Involved.</h1>
            <p> Whether you're a designer, developer, writer, or stakeholder, accessibility starts with awareness.
                Learn about inclusive practices, use tools like screen readers to test your work, and advocate for accessibility in your teams.
                <strong><u>Together, we can build a web that works for everyone.</u></strong>
