                <p> <strong><u>Digital Accessibility</u></strong> is the design of technology products and environments
                    to help people with various disabilities not to be
                    impeded or otherwise unable to partake in use of the service, product or function. </p>

                <p>It ensures that websites, applications, and digital tools are usable by everyone, regardless of their
                    abilities. This includes people with visual, auditory, motor, or cognitive disabilities.
                    Accessible design removes barriers, enabling all users to perceive, understand, navigate, and
                    interact with digital content effectively.</p>

                <h2 class="matters-head-section"><u>Why it Matters?</u></h2>
                <p> Accessibility is not just a legal requiremnt or a checklist item, it's a commitment to
                    <i>inclusion</i>. Over one billion people globally live with a disability,
                    and when digital experiences aren't built with them in mind, they're excluded from vital
                    information, services, and opportunities.
                </p>
                <p>By prioritzing accessibility, we create equitable experiences and open the door to innovation that
                    benefits everyone.</p>

                <h2 class="benefits-head-section"><u>Who Benefits from Accessibility?</u></h2>
                <p> Everyone can benefit from digital accessibility. Accessibiltity features like <strong>closed captions, voice
                    commands, text resizing,</strong> and <strong>keyboard navigation</strong> improve usability for all users.
                    Whether you're navigating a site in bright sunlight or using a slow internet connection, accessible
                    design makes digital experiences smoother, faster, and more intuitive.

                    <li>
                        <strong> Use Clear, Simple Language</strong>
                        <p> Write in a way that's easy to read and understand. Avoid jargon or overly complex sentence
                            structures, especially on high-traffic or instructional pages.
                        </p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Add Alt Texts to All Images</strong>
                        <p> Ensure all meaningful images have desciptive alternative (alt) text so screen reader users can
                            understand the content and purpose of visuals.
                        </p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Ensure Good Color Contrast</strong>
                        <p> Use high-contrast color combinations between text and background. This helps users with low
                            vision or color blindness read your content with ease.
                        </p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Make All Content Keyboard Accessible</strong>
                        <p> Ensure that every part of your website or app can be navigated using a keyboard alone. This
                            is essential for users who cannot use a mouse.
                        </p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Use Headings Properly</strong>
                        <p> Structure content using proper heading levels (e.g., H1 for main titles, H2 for
                            subheadings). This helps screen reader users navigate more efficiently.
                        </p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Provide Captions and Transcripts</strong>
                        <p> Include closed captions for videos and transcripts for audio content to make multimedia
                            accessible to users who are deaf or hard of hearing.
                        </p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Avoid Using Color Alone to Convey Meaning</strong>
                        <p> If you're using color to show status (like red for errors), pair it with icons or text to
                            ensure the information is accessible to colorblind users.
                        </p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Label Form Fields Clearly</strong>
                        <p> All form fields should have visible, descriptive labels. Use ARIA labels or label tags to
                            ensure screen readers can interpret them accurately.
                        </p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Design Responsive, Scalable Layouts</strong>
                        <p> Make sure your site or app works well on all screen sizes and allows text resizing without
                            breaking the layout.
                        </p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Test with Real Users and Assistive Tech</strong>
                        <p> Incorporate feedback from people with disabilities and test with tools like screen readers,
                            voice control software, and browser zoom.
                        </p>

                    <p> We believe accessibility is a shared responsibility. Our team incorporates inclusive design
                        principles from the ground up and routinely tests our digital experiences
                        against global standards like the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG).
                        But our efforts go beyond compliances, we strive to foster a digital culture where everyone
                        feels welcomed, seen, and empowered.

                    <p> Whether you're a designer, developer, writer, or stakeholder, accessibility starts with
                        awareness.
                        Learn about inclusive practices, use tools like screen readers to test your work, and advocate
                        for accessibility in your teams.</p>
