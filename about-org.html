            <p class="flow-text center align">We are a nonprofit made up of problem solvers. The problem? We have the
                world in the palms of our
                hands- at least some of us do. But websites and software tend to be geared toward those of us who have
                excellent vision, great
                memory, good hearing, two hands, and perfect dexterity. That means that the internet is exclusive. We
                work with brands and business
                owners to make their digital presence more inclusive. We rework their websites and apps with
                accessibility in mind, and we do it for
                free. Our goal is to create a digital world where there is compassion built into the code. Our funding
                comes from our sponsors, who
                continuously buy into our vision because they believe in the cause as much as we do. With this funding,
                we can educate a new generation
                of software engineers who are aware of the accessibility gap and work to close it. Some of these
                engineers go on to work at large
                corporations where they can make meaningful changes to systems that affect our everyday lives. We also
                educate small business owners who
                may not have the budget to employ an entire department focused on accessibility, because the internet is
                better when we all have access.
